# JUDGMENTAL MODEL OF THE EBBINGHAUS ILLUSION

## Code
* This experiment was written using Python 2.7.15 to participate in the MARVIN contest by "Think Cognitive Think Sciense" organization.
* Used libraries: psychopy, random, math.

## Procedure
* For a description of the experiment please see [the original article (p. 148)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/17615560_Judgmental_model_of_the_Ebbinghaus_illusion)

## Notes
* Ebbinghaus illusion is a pretty simple experiment, so i decided make code blocks as much universal as I can, so it can be reused in other experiments.
